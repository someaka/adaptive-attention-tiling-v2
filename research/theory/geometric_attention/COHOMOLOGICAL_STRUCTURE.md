# Cohomological Structure of Attention Patterns

## Abstract

This document explores the cohomological structure of attention patterns, showing how attention mechanisms naturally give rise to cohomology classes on our computational manifold. This perspective reveals deep connections between attention, topology, and information flow.

## Cohomological Framework

### 1. De Rham Complex
```math
Ω^0 → Ω^1 → Ω^2 → ... → Ω^n
```

Where:
- Ω^k are k-forms on attention manifold
- d is exterior derivative
- Kernel/Image give cohomology groups
- Forms represent attention patterns

### 2. Attention Forms
```math
ω = ∑_{i₁...i_k} ω_{i₁...i_k}dx^{i₁}∧...∧dx^{i_k}
```

Properties:
- 0-forms are attention values
- 1-forms are attention gradients
- 2-forms are attention curvature
- Higher forms are pattern interactions

## Local Structure

### 1. Čech Cohomology
```math
H^k(U, F)
```

For:
- U is tile cover
- F is attention sheaf
- Local-to-global principle
- Mayer-Vietoris sequences

### 2. Implementation
```python
class LocalCohomology:
    def compute_local(self, tile):
        """Compute local cohomology"""
        # Local forms
        forms = self.differential_forms(tile)
        
        # Cohomology computation
        return self.compute_cohomology(forms)
```

## Spectral Sequences

### 1. Attention Spectral Sequence
```math
E^{p,q}_r ⟹ H^{p+q}(M)
```

Structure:
- Filtration by attention depth
- Convergence to global cohomology
- Differential structure
- Pattern persistence

### 2. Computation
```python
class SpectralSequence:
    def compute_sequence(self, filtration):
        """Compute spectral sequence"""
        # Initialize pages
        pages = self.initialize_pages(filtration)
        
        # Compute differentials
        return self.compute_differentials(pages)
```

## Sheaf Theory

### 1. Attention Sheaf
```math
F: Open → Module
```

Properties:
- Local sections are patterns
- Gluing conditions
- Restriction maps
- Sheaf cohomology

### 2. Implementation
```python
class AttentionSheaf:
    def compute_sections(self, open_set):
        """Compute sheaf sections"""
        # Local data
        local = self.local_sections(open_set)
        
        # Gluing maps
        return self.glue_sections(local)
```

## Higher Structure

### 1. ∞-Categories
```math
N(A)_n = Fun([n], A)
```

Representing:
- Higher morphisms
- Homotopy coherence
- Pattern composition
- Attention transformations

### 2. Implementation
```python
class InfinityCategory:
    def compute_morphisms(self, source, target):
        """Compute higher morphisms"""
        # Simplicial set
        nerve = self.compute_nerve(source, target)
        
        # Higher structure
        return self.higher_morphisms(nerve)
```

## Pattern Persistence

### 1. Persistent Cohomology
```math
H^k(M_t) → H^k(M_{t'})
```

Tracking:
- Pattern evolution
- Feature persistence
- Attention flow
- Topological features

### 2. Computation
```python
class PersistentPatterns:
    def track_persistence(self, time_series):
        """Track pattern persistence"""
        # Persistence diagram
        diagram = self.compute_persistence(time_series)
        
        # Feature analysis
        return self.analyze_features(diagram)
```

## Quantum Structure

### 1. Quantum Cohomology
```math
QH^*(M) = H^*(M) ⊗ ℂ[[q]]
```

Features:
- Quantum corrections
- Gromov-Witten invariants
- Pattern quantization
- Quantum persistence

### 2. Implementation
```python
class QuantumCohomology:
    def compute_quantum(self, classical):
        """Compute quantum cohomology"""
        # Quantum corrections
        corrections = self.quantum_corrections(classical)
        
        # Full structure
        return self.quantum_product(corrections)
```

## Applications

### 1. Pattern Analysis
```python
class PatternAnalysis:
    def analyze_patterns(self, attention_data):
        """Analyze attention patterns"""
        # Cohomological analysis
        cohomology = self.compute_cohomology(attention_data)
        
        # Feature extraction
        return self.extract_features(cohomology)
```

### 2. Flow Structure
```python
class FlowStructure:
    def analyze_flow(self, attention_flow):
        """Analyze attention flow"""
        # Flow cohomology
        flow_cohomology = self.flow_to_cohomology(attention_flow)
        
        # Structure analysis
        return self.analyze_structure(flow_cohomology)
```
