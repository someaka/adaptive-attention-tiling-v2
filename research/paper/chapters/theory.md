# Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework

## 3.1 From Geometric to Information Spaces

The core insight of our approach draws from an elegant parallel between geometric complexity in 3D rendering and information density in neural attention. Just as Unreal Engine's Nanite system dynamically manages geometric detail based on visual importance, we propose a system that dynamically manages computational resources based on information density.

### 3.1.1 The Information Manifold

Consider a sequence of tokens $x_1, ..., x_n$ processed by a neural network. Traditional attention mechanisms treat this sequence uniformly, leading to quadratic complexity. Instead, we propose viewing this sequence as points on an information manifold $\mathcal{M}$, where:

- Local information density $\rho(x)$ at a point $x$ is measured by the rate of change in the model's internal state
- The manifold's metric tensor $g_{ij}(x)$ captures the local structure of information relationships
- Geodesics on this manifold represent paths of efficient information flow

## 3.2 Dynamic Tiling of Attention

### 3.2.1 Tile Definition

A tile $T_i$ in our system is defined as:

$T_i = (M_i, S_i, R_i)$

where:
- $M_i$ is a Mamba state space block
- $S_i$ is the state space dimension
- $R_i$ is the effective resolution (processing granularity)

### 3.2.2 Resolution Adaptation

The resolution $R_i$ of each tile is determined by:

$R_i = f(\rho_i, d_i, c_i)$

where:
- $\rho_i$ is local information density
- $d_i$ is temporal distance
- $c_i$ is computational budget
- $f$ is an adaptive function that balances these factors

## 3.3 Information Flow Between Tiles

### 3.3.1 State Space Transitions

For adjacent tiles $T_i$ and $T_{i+1}$, state transition is governed by:

$s_{i+1} = \phi(s_i, R_i, R_{i+1})$

where:
- $s_i$ is the state vector of tile $T_i$
- $\phi$ is a learnable transition function that adapts to resolution changes

### 3.3.2 Cross-Scale Information Routing

Information flow between tiles of different resolutions follows:

$y_{i \rightarrow j} = \sigma(W_s s_i + W_r (R_i - R_j))$

where:
- $y_{i \rightarrow j}$ is the information passed from tile $i$ to $j$
- $W_s$ and $W_r$ are learnable parameters
- $\sigma$ is a nonlinear activation

## 3.4 Dynamic Adaptation Algorithm

The system continuously optimizes tile configuration through:

1. Information Density Estimation:
   $\rho(x) = \|\nabla_x s\|_2^2$

2. Resolution Assignment:
   $R^* = \arg\min_R \mathcal{L}_{task} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{compute}$

3. State Space Adjustment:
   $S_i = \max(\min(k\rho_i, S_{max}), S_{min})$

where $\mathcal{L}_{task}$ is task-specific loss and $\mathcal{L}_{compute}$ is computational cost.

## 3.5 Theoretical Properties

### 3.5.1 Computational Complexity

For a sequence of length $n$ divided into $m$ tiles, our method achieves:

$O(n \cdot \sum_{i=1}^m R_i)$ complexity

where typically $\sum_{i=1}^m R_i \ll n$, providing significant efficiency gains over traditional $O(n^2)$ attention.

### 3.5.2 Information Preservation

We prove that under reasonable assumptions about information density distribution, our tiling approach preserves information up to a bounded error $\epsilon$:

$\|y_{tiled} - y_{full}\|_2 \leq \epsilon \cdot \max_i \rho_i$

This bound ensures that high-information regions maintain high fidelity while allowing efficiency gains in low-information regions.

## 3.6 Relationship to Existing Frameworks

Our approach can be viewed as a generalization of:
- Traditional attention (when all tiles have maximum resolution)
- Linear attention (when using uniform tile sizes)
- Sparse attention (when using binary resolution choices)

The key innovation is the continuous, dynamic adaptation of computational resources based on local information geometry, analogous to geometric Level of Detail systems but operating in the space of neural computation.
