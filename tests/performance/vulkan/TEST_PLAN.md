## Test Implementation Strategy

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Initialize Vulkan instance and device
   - Create command pools and queues
   - Allocate memory pools
   - Load compute shaders

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Run tests in isolation
   - Measure performance metrics
   - Validate results against CPU implementation
   - Check resource usage

3. **Cleanup Phase**
   - Release all resources
   - Verify no memory leaks
   - Reset device state

## Validation Methods

1. **Correctness Testing**
   - Compare against PyTorch CPU results
   - Validate numerical accuracy (within epsilon)
   - Check edge cases and boundary conditions

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Use benchmark fixtures
   - Record timing information
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Generate performance reports

3. **Resource Testing**
   - Track allocations/deallocations
   - Monitor memory fragmentation
   - Verify cleanup completeness
