# Test Specification

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, ensuring each piece functions correctly on its own.

### Integration Tests
Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly, focusing on component interactions and data flow.

### Performance Tests
Performance tests measure the system's efficiency, memory usage, and computational overhead.

### Benchmark Tests
Benchmark tests compare our implementation against baseline models and existing attention mechanisms.
