# Test Specification

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, ensuring each piece functions correctly on its own.

### Integration Tests
Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly, focusing on component interactions and data flow.

### Performance Tests
Performance tests measure the system's efficiency, memory usage, and computational overhead.

### Benchmark Tests
Benchmark tests compare our implementation against baseline models and existing attention mechanisms.

## Test Organization

### Test Levels

The test suite is organized into hierarchical levels based on functionality and dependencies:

#### Level 0: Core Functionality (33 tests)
- Basic functionality tests
- Helper functions
- Setup and initialization
- No dependencies on other tests

#### Level 1: Component Tests

##### Level 1.0: Geometric Operations (139 tests)
- Metric tensors
- Geometric distances
- Projections
- Depends on Level 0

##### Level 1.1: Quantum Operations (72 tests)
- Quantum states
- Measurements
- Entanglement
- Depends on Level 0 and Level 1.0

##### Level 1.2: Pattern Operations (186 tests)
- Pattern flows
- Diffusion systems
- Reaction systems
- Depends on Level 0 and Level 1.0

##### Level 1.3: Neural Network Operations (18 tests)
- Attention mechanisms
- Network layers
- Neural computations
- Depends on Level 0 and Level 1.0

##### Level 1.4: Validation Operations (47 tests)
- Verification functions
- Assertions
- System checks
- Depends on Level 0 and Level 1.0

#### Level 2: Integration Tests (39 tests)
- End-to-end tests
- Performance tests
- Advanced features
- Depends on all Level 1.x tests

## Running Tests by Level

To run tests at a specific level:
```bash
# Run level 0 tests
python -m pytest -v -m "level0"

# Run level 1.0 tests (geometric)
python -m pytest -v -m "level10"

# Run level 1.1 tests (quantum)
python -m pytest -v -m "level11"

# Run level 1.2 tests (pattern)
python -m pytest -v -m "level12"

# Run level 1.3 tests (neural)
python -m pytest -v -m "level13"

# Run level 1.4 tests (validation)
python -m pytest -v -m "level14"

# Run level 2 tests (integration)
python -m pytest -v -m "level20"

# Run all tests in dependency order
python -m pytest -v -m "level0 or level10 or level11 or level12 or level13 or level14 or level20" --order-dependencies
```

## Test Categories

Tests are also marked with categories:
- `core`: Core functionality tests
- `geometric`: Geometric operations
- `attention`: Attention mechanism
- `tiling`: Tiling operations
- `integration`: Integration tests
- `performance`: Performance tests
- `memory`: Memory management tests

To run tests by category:
```bash
python -m pytest -v -m "geometric"  # Run geometric tests
python -m pytest -v -m "attention"  # Run attention tests
# etc.
```

## Test Dependencies

Tests are organized with explicit dependencies using the `pytest-dependency` plugin. The dependency graph ensures that:

1. Level 0 tests run first (no dependencies)
2. Level 1.x tests depend on Level 0 tests in their module
3. Level 2 tests depend on relevant Level 1.x tests
4. Within each level, tests can have additional dependencies on other tests at the same level

Dependencies are automatically managed based on the test levels and module structure.
