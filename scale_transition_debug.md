# Scale Transition Debug Log

## Problem Description
The scale transition implementation has stability issues, particularly with the validation of large scale differences. The tests show that perturbations are being amplified by factors proportional to the scale change (2x for 0.5->1.0, 4x for 0.5->2.0).

## Test Requirements
- Test: `test_scale_transition_stability`
- Condition: `base_diff < eps * 10` where:
  - `base_diff`: norm of difference between transitioned states
  - `eps`: perturbation size (1e-4 or 1e-3)

## Attempts

### Attempt 1: Direct Delta Control
- Approach: Implemented direct control of delta magnitude during transitions
- Implementation:
```python
# Scale max_delta inversely with scale factor
max_delta = 0.0001 / scale_factor
# Apply soft clamping using sigmoid
scale = max_delta * torch.sigmoid(2 * delta_norm / max_delta) / (delta_norm + 1e-6)
curr_state = ref_state + delta * scale
```
- Result: Failed - still got 2x/4x amplification
- Issue: Scaling max_delta wasn't enough to control perturbation growth

### Attempt 2: Accumulator State
- Approach: Used an accumulator to track total changes
- Implementation:
```python
# Initialize accumulator for stability
accum_state = curr_state.clone()
# Compute change relative to accumulated state
delta = next_state - accum_state
# Update accumulator and current state
accum_state = accum_state + delta * scale
curr_state = self._normalize_state(accum_state)
```
- Result: Failed - amplification factors unchanged
- Issue: Accumulator didn't prevent perturbation amplification

### Attempt 3: Normalized Deltas
- Approach: Normalized perturbations at each step
- Implementation:
```python
# Normalize delta to maintain stability
delta = F.normalize(delta, p=2, dim=-1) * delta_norm.clamp(max=0.0001)
curr_state = ref_state + delta
```
- Result: Failed - still got amplification
- Issue: Normalization alone wasn't enough to control growth

### Attempt 4: Scale-Aware Delta Control
- Approach: Scale deltas with current transition factor
- Implementation:
```python
# Track current scale factor
curr_factor = 1.0
curr_factor *= step_factor
# Scale delta by current factor
delta = F.normalize(delta, p=2, dim=-1) * delta_norm.clamp(max=0.0001 * curr_factor)
```
- Result: Failed - amplification still present
- Issue: Scaling deltas proportionally didn't help

### Attempt 5: End-State Normalization
- Approach: Normalize perturbations at the end of transition
- Implementation:
```python
# Compute scale adjustment to maintain stability
delta_norm = (ref_norm - target_norm).abs()
max_delta = 0.0001 * target_norm
scale = torch.where(
    delta_norm > max_delta,
    target_norm + max_delta * torch.sign(delta_norm),
    ref_norm
)
return state * (scale / ref_norm)
```
- Result: Failed - still seeing 2x/4x amplification
- Issue: End-state normalization wasn't enough to control accumulated growth

### Attempt 6: Lipschitz Normalization
- Approach: Use Lipschitz normalization to bound changes relative to input
- Implementation:
```python
# Apply Lipschitz normalization to control perturbation growth
lipschitz_const = 1.0 / scale_factor  # Scale inversely with total scale change
delta_norm = torch.linalg.vector_norm(delta, dim=-1, keepdim=True)
ref_norm = torch.linalg.vector_norm(ref_state, dim=-1, keepdim=True)

# Compute maximum allowed change based on Lipschitz constant
max_change = lipschitz_const * ref_norm

# Apply soft clamping to maintain stability
scale = torch.where(
    delta_norm > max_change,
    max_change / (delta_norm + 1e-6),
    torch.ones_like(delta_norm)
)
curr_state = ref_state + delta * scale
```
- Result: Failed - still seeing 2x/4x amplification
- Issue: Even with Lipschitz normalization, perturbations still grow with scale changes

### Attempt 7: Residual Connections
- Approach: Use residual connections to accumulate changes gradually
- Implementation:
```python
# Initialize residual
residual = torch.zeros_like(curr_state)

# Apply transition with residual connection
next_state = transition_modules[curr_step - 1](curr_state)
residual = residual + (next_state - curr_state) * step_factor

# Apply residual with stability control
delta = residual.clone()
delta_norm = torch.linalg.vector_norm(delta, dim=-1, keepdim=True)
max_delta = 0.0001 * orig_norm  # Scale with original norm

# Apply soft clamping to maintain stability
scale = torch.where(
    delta_norm > max_delta,
    max_delta / (delta_norm + 1e-6),
    torch.ones_like(delta_norm)
)
curr_state = ref_state + delta * scale
```
- Result: Failed - still seeing 2x/4x amplification
- Issue: Residual connections didn't prevent perturbation growth

### Attempt 8: Gradient-Based Stability Control
- Approach: Use gradients to control stability during transitions
- Implementation:
```python
# Enable gradient computation for stability control
curr_state.requires_grad_(True)
ref_state.requires_grad_(True)

# Apply transition
next_state = transition_modules[curr_step - 1](curr_state)

# Compute gradient of output with respect to input
grad = torch.autograd.grad(
    next_state.sum(),
    curr_state,
    create_graph=True
)[0]

# Accumulate gradient for stability control
grad_accum = grad_accum + grad * step_factor

# Compute stability-controlled update
grad_norm = torch.linalg.vector_norm(grad_accum, dim=-1, keepdim=True)
max_grad = 0.0001 * orig_norm  # Scale with original norm

# Apply soft gradient clipping
scale = torch.where(
    grad_norm > max_grad,
    max_grad / (grad_norm + 1e-6),
    torch.ones_like(grad_norm)
)

# Update state with controlled gradient
with torch.no_grad():
    curr_state = ref_state + grad_accum * scale
    curr_state = self._normalize_state(curr_state)
    ref_state = curr_state.clone()
```
- Result: Failed - still seeing 2x/4x amplification and lost reversibility
- Issue: Gradient accumulation led to loss of reversibility

### Attempt 9: Attention-Based Control
- Approach: Use attention mechanisms to control information flow during transitions
- Implementation:
```python
# Compute attention scores for stability control
query = curr_state
key = next_state
value = next_state - curr_state

# Scale dot product attention
attn_scale = 1.0 / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(curr_state.size(-1), dtype=torch.float32))
attn_scores = torch.sum(query * key, dim=-1, keepdim=True) * attn_scale

# Compute attention weights with stability control
max_change = 0.0001 * orig_norm  # Scale with original norm
attn_weights = torch.sigmoid(attn_scores) * (max_change / (torch.linalg.vector_norm(value, dim=-1, keepdim=True) + 1e-6))

# Update context with attention-weighted changes
context = context + value * attn_weights * step_factor

# Apply controlled update
curr_state = ref_state + context
curr_state = self._normalize_state(curr_state)
ref_state = curr_state.clone()
```
- Result: Fixed reversibility but still seeing 2x/4x amplification
- Issue: Attention control didn't prevent perturbation growth

### Attempt 10: Adaptive Stability Thresholds
- Approach: Use adaptive thresholds based on transition history
- Implementation:
```python
# Compute change and update stability history
delta = next_state - curr_state
delta_norm = torch.linalg.vector_norm(delta, dim=-1, keepdim=True)
stability_history.append(delta_norm)

# Compute adaptive stability threshold
if len(stability_history) > 1:
    # Use exponential moving average of past changes
    history_tensor = torch.stack(stability_history, dim=0)
    weights = torch.exp(-torch.arange(len(stability_history), device=delta.device))
    weights = weights / weights.sum()
    avg_change = torch.sum(history_tensor * weights.view(-1, 1, 1), dim=0)
    max_change = avg_change.clamp(min=0.0001 * orig_norm)
else:
    max_change = 0.0001 * orig_norm

# Apply adaptive stability control
scale = torch.where(
    delta_norm > max_change,
    max_change / (delta_norm + 1e-6),
    torch.ones_like(delta_norm)
)

# Update state with controlled change
curr_state = curr_state + delta * scale * step_factor
curr_state = self._normalize_state(curr_state)
ref_state = curr_state.clone()
```
- Rationale: By adapting stability thresholds based on the history of changes, we can better control perturbation growth
- Key insight: Use exponential moving average to give more weight to recent changes while maintaining stability

## Current Status
- All tests passing except `test_scale_transition_stability`
- Main issue: Perturbations are being amplified proportionally to scale changes
- Need to find a way to maintain stability without compromising scale transition accuracy

## Next Steps
1. Consider alternative approaches:
   - Try using multi-scale attention
   - Consider using a more sophisticated normalization scheme
   - Look into using hierarchical stability control
2. Analyze why perturbations grow proportionally to scale changes
3. Consider if the test requirements are too strict
