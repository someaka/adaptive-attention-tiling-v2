# ðŸ“Š Metrics Context Note

## Recent Validation Run (December 4, 2024)

The current metrics (Adaptive: 7.95 vs Baseline: 7.73) reflect an initial validation run primarily focused on testing the complete pipeline functionality rather than performance optimization. Key context:

- Recently added new datasets (GitHub Code, C4) alongside existing Wikitext
- Run duration optimized for pipeline validation, not statistical significance
- Previous runs with single dataset showed more favorable metrics
- Primary goal was end-to-end pipeline verification with multiple datasets

### Next Steps
- Extend run duration for statistical significance
- Fine-tune parameters for new dataset mix
- Implement comprehensive statistical validation
- Generate detailed performance profiles

### Priority: Dataset Expansion
Our immediate focus is expanding our validation suite with standard attention mechanism benchmarks:

1. **Long-Range Arena (LRA) Suite**
   - ListOps: Tests handling of nested structures (2K tokens)
   - IMDB Reviews: Text classification with sentiment (4K tokens)
   - AAN Paper Similarity: Document retrieval (8K tokens)
   - Sequential CIFAR-10: Image processing (1K tokens)
   - Pathfinder: Long-range spatial dependencies (16K tokens)

These additions are crucial as they test different aspects of attention mechanisms:
- Hierarchical structure processing
- Long-range dependency handling
- Cross-domain applicability
- Various sequence lengths (1K-16K tokens)

The diversity of these datasets will provide a more comprehensive evaluation of our adaptive tiling approach across different attention patterns and information structures.

This note serves as context for anyone reviewing the current metrics in isolation.
