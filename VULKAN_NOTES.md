# Vulkan Performance Notes

## Test Environment
- Custom PyTorch build with Vulkan support (torch-2.6.0a0+git1815a32)
- Resource-constrained laptop environment

## Key Findings

### Performance by Operation Size
- Small matrices (512x512):
  - Element-wise operations excel on Vulkan
  - Addition: 4.57x faster
  - Multiplication: 5.12x faster
  - ReLU: 5.37x faster

- Medium matrices (1024x1024):
  - Moderate gains on element-wise ops
  - Addition: 1.71x faster
  - ReLU: 2.05x faster
  - Multiplication shows performance drop

- Large matrices (2048x2048):
  - All operations slower on Vulkan
  - Likely due to memory constraints and transfer overhead

### Operation-Specific Notes
- Matrix multiplication consistently slower on Vulkan
  - CPU likely using highly optimized BLAS implementation
  - Memory transfer overhead more significant for matmul

### Hardware Considerations
- Performance degradation on larger matrices likely due to:
  - Limited GPU memory
  - Memory transfer overhead
  - System resource contention
  - Thermal throttling on laptop hardware

## Recommendations
1. Prefer Vulkan for element-wise operations on smaller matrices (â‰¤512x512)
2. Consider batch processing for larger operations to avoid memory pressure
3. CPU might be preferable for matrix multiplication operations
4. Monitor system resources when processing large matrices

## Future Work
- Test with batched operations to mitigate memory pressure
- Profile memory transfer overhead
- Investigate optimal matrix size thresholds for different operations
