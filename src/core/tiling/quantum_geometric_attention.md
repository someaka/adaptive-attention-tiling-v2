# Quantum Geometric Attention

## Overview
The Quantum Geometric Attention mechanism represents a novel approach to attention that leverages principles from quantum mechanics and differential geometry. This implementation bridges the gap between traditional transformer attention and quantum information theory.

## Key Components

### 1. Quantum State Representation
- **Purpose**: Represents attention patterns as quantum states in a Hilbert space
- **Implementation**: Uses complex-valued tensors to represent quantum amplitudes
- **Key Methods**:
  - `_prepare_quantum_state`: Converts input tensors to quantum state representation
  - `_measure_quantum_state`: Projects quantum state back to classical representation

### 2. Geometric Flow
- **Purpose**: Models attention as geometric flow on a manifold
- **Implementation**: Uses Ricci flow to evolve attention patterns
- **Key Methods**:
  - `_compute_ricci_curvature`: Calculates geometric curvature of attention
  - `_evolve_geometric_flow`: Updates attention weights based on curvature

### 3. Quantum Metrics
- **Purpose**: Measures quantum properties of attention
- **Implementation**: Computes quantum information theoretic metrics
- **Key Methods**:
  - `_compute_von_neumann_entropy`: Quantum entropy of attention
  - `_compute_quantum_fisher_information`: Information geometry metric

### 4. Attention Mechanism
- **Purpose**: Core attention computation with quantum geometric properties
- **Implementation**: Combines quantum states with geometric evolution
- **Key Methods**:
  - `forward`: Main attention computation
  - `_quantum_attention`: Quantum-aware attention weights
  - `_geometric_update`: Updates based on manifold structure

## Mathematical Foundation

### Quantum State Space
The attention patterns are represented in a quantum Hilbert space H where:
- States are complex-valued vectors
- Inner products define attention similarities
- Superposition allows for quantum interference effects

### Geometric Structure
The attention manifold M is equipped with:
- Riemannian metric g capturing attention geometry
- Connection ∇ for parallel transport of attention
- Curvature R measuring attention pattern interaction

### Evolution Equations
The attention patterns evolve according to:
1. Schrödinger-like equation for quantum states
2. Ricci flow for geometric structure
3. Combined quantum-geometric update rule

## Implementation Details

### State Preparation
```python
def _prepare_quantum_state(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Convert classical tensor to quantum state
    # Apply normalization and phase encoding
```

### Geometric Evolution
```python
def _evolve_geometric_flow(self, attention: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Compute Ricci curvature
    # Update metric using flow equation
    # Project back to attention space
```

### Quantum Measurement
```python
def _measure_quantum_state(self, state: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Project quantum state to classical representation
    # Apply measurement postulates
    # Return classical attention weights
```

## Usage Example
```python
attention = QuantumGeometricAttention(
    dim=512,
    heads=8,
    quantum_dim=32
)
output = attention(x)
```

## Integration Points

### With Base Attention
- Extends traditional attention with quantum properties
- Maintains compatibility with transformer architecture
- Adds quantum geometric metrics

### With Tiling System
- Quantum states respect tile boundaries
- Geometric flow preserves tiling structure
- Metrics compute per-tile quantum properties

## Performance Considerations

### Computational Complexity
- Quantum state preparation: O(n²d)
- Geometric flow evolution: O(n²)
- Total complexity comparable to standard attention

### Memory Usage
- Additional quantum state storage: O(n²q)
- Geometric metric storage: O(n²)
- q: quantum dimension (typically small)

## Future Directions

1. **Quantum Optimization**
   - Quantum-inspired optimization algorithms
   - Adiabatic evolution for attention

2. **Geometric Extensions**
   - Higher-order curvature terms
   - More sophisticated geometric flows

3. **Integration Improvements**
