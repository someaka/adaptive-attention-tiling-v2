"""Implementation of diffusion dynamics.

This module implements a conservative diffusion system that preserves several key properties:
1. Mass conservation - The total mass (sum) of the system remains constant
2. Maximum principle - Values remain bounded by their initial min/max
3. Symmetry preservation - The diffusion process respects the underlying grid symmetries
4. Convergence to steady state - The system evolves towards a uniform distribution

    This class implements a discrete diffusion process using a symmetric 9-point stencil.
    The implementation ensures several physical properties are preserved:
    
    1. Mass Conservation:
       - The sum of all values remains constant throughout the diffusion
       - Achieved through kernel normalization and exact correction
       
    2. Maximum Principle:
       - Values remain bounded by their initial min/max
       - Enforced through explicit clamping
       
    3. Symmetry Preservation:
       - The diffusion kernel is symmetric
       - Periodic boundary conditions maintain spatial symmetry
       
    4. Convergence Properties:
       - System converges to uniform steady state
       - Rate controlled by diffusion coefficient and time step
