## Progress Tracking
- Total Integration Points: 41
- Completed: 28
- In Progress: 2
- Remaining: 11
- Integration Progress: 68.3%

## Integration Guidelines
1. Each component should be integrated in sequence
2. Dependencies flow downward (higher numbers depend on lower)
3. Each integration point should be tested before moving to next
4. Document any circular dependencies discovered during integration

## Validation Requirements
1. Each integration point must:
   - Pass all unit tests
   - Maintain numerical stability
   - Preserve theoretical invariants
   - Document edge cases

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining Cohomology Framework integration
2. Finish Path Integral Framework implementation
3. Address Crystal Structure integration points
4. Verify all cross-component interactions
