## Progress Tracking
- Total Integration Points: 41
- Completed: 10
- In Progress: 0
- Remaining: 31
- Integration Progress: 24.4%

## Integration Guidelines
1. Each component should be integrated in sequence
2. Dependencies flow downward (higher numbers depend on lower)
3. Each integration point should be tested before moving to next
4. Document any circular dependencies discovered during integration

## Validation Requirements
1. Each integration point must:
   - Pass all unit tests
   - Maintain numerical stability
   - Preserve theoretical invariants
   - Document edge cases

## Next Steps
1. Continue with Riemannian Structure Integration
2. Test pattern-specific features thoroughly
3. Verify pattern dynamics integration
4. Proceed with cohomology framework integration
