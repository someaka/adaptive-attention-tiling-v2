# Phase Composition Debug Log

## Problem Description
The operator product expansion (OPE) in `HolographicLifter` needs to preserve both U(1) structure and associativity when composing phases. The tests are failing with the following requirements:
1. U(1) structure preservation: phase_error < 1e-2
2. Associativity: assoc_error < 0.1

## Attempts

### Attempt 1: Direct Phase Addition
```python
composed_phase = global_phase1 + global_phase2
composed_phase = torch.remainder(composed_phase + torch.pi, 2 * torch.pi) - torch.pi
```
- Result: Failed U(1) test with error ~0.58
- Failed associativity test with error ~1.64
- Issue: Simple addition doesn't preserve U(1) structure

### Attempt 2: Weighted Average with Norms
```python
weight1 = norm1 / (norm1 + norm2)
weight2 = norm2 / (norm1 + norm2)
composed_phase = weight1 * global_phase1 + weight2 * global_phase2
```
- Result: Failed U(1) test with error ~0.39
- Failed associativity test with error ~0.58
- Issue: Weighting by norms breaks U(1) structure

### Attempt 3: Geometric Mean on Unit Circle
```python
z1 = torch.exp(1j * global_phase1)
z2 = torch.exp(1j * global_phase2)
z_composed = torch.sqrt(z1 * z2)
composed_phase = torch.angle(z_composed)
```
- Result: Failed U(1) test with error ~1.66
- Failed associativity test with error ~0.91
- Issue: Geometric mean doesn't preserve U(1) structure

### Attempt 4: First Phase with Internal Structure
```python
result = result * phase1
internal_phase = phase2 / phase1
result = result * torch.sqrt(internal_phase)
```
- Result: Failed U(1) test with error ~1.41
- Failed associativity test with error ~1.00
- Issue: Internal phase structure breaks U(1)

### Attempt 5: Symmetric Phase Composition
```python
composed_angle = (phase1_angle + phase2_angle) / 2.0
composed_phase = torch.exp(1j * composed_angle)
```
- Result: Failed U(1) test with error ~1.11
- Failed associativity test with error ~0.91
- Issue: Simple averaging doesn't preserve U(1) structure

### Attempt 6: Lie Group Theory Approach
```python
# Convert phases to Lie algebra (take log)
log_phase1 = torch.log(phase1)  # = i * global_phase1
log_phase2 = torch.log(phase2)  # = i * global_phase2

# Compose in Lie algebra (add generators)
composed_log = log_phase1 + log_phase2

# Map back to group via exponential map
composed_phase = torch.exp(composed_log)
```
- Result: Failed associativity test with error ~1.39
- Issue: Log/exp operations introduce numerical instability

### Attempt 7: Quaternion Representation
```python
# Convert phases to quaternion representation (i component only)
q1_i = torch.sin(global_phase1)  # i component
q1_r = torch.cos(global_phase1)  # real component
q2_i = torch.sin(global_phase2)  # i component
q2_r = torch.cos(global_phase2)  # real component

# Compose quaternions (Hamilton product restricted to U(1) subgroup)
qr = q1_r * q2_r - q1_i * q2_i  # real part
qi = q1_r * q2_i + q1_i * q2_r  # i component

# Convert back to complex phase
composed_phase = torch.complex(qr, qi)
```
- Result: Failed U(1) test with error ~1.41
- Issue: Quaternion composition doesn't preserve U(1) structure

### Attempt 8: SU(2) Double Cover
```python
# Convert phases to SU(2) representation
half_phase1 = global_phase1 / 2
half_phase2 = global_phase2 / 2

# Create SU(2) matrices for each phase
su2_1 = torch.stack([
    torch.cos(half_phase1), -torch.sin(half_phase1),
    torch.sin(half_phase1), torch.cos(half_phase1)
]).reshape(2, 2)

su2_2 = torch.stack([
    torch.cos(half_phase2), -torch.sin(half_phase2),
    torch.sin(half_phase2), torch.cos(half_phase2)
]).reshape(2, 2)

# Compose SU(2) matrices
su2_composed = torch.matmul(su2_1, su2_2)

# Extract composed phase
composed_phase = torch.complex(
    su2_composed[0, 0],  # real part
    su2_composed[1, 0]   # imaginary part
)
```
- Result: Failed U(1) test with error ~0.39
- Issue: SU(2) composition introduces additional phase factors

### Attempt 9: Hopf Fibration
```python
# Convert phases to S³ coordinates
s3_1 = torch.stack([
    torch.cos(global_phase1/2),  # w coordinate
    torch.sin(global_phase1/2),  # x coordinate
    torch.zeros_like(global_phase1),  # y coordinate
    torch.zeros_like(global_phase1)   # z coordinate
])

s3_2 = torch.stack([
    torch.cos(global_phase2/2),  # w coordinate
    torch.sin(global_phase2/2),  # x coordinate
    torch.zeros_like(global_phase2),  # y coordinate
    torch.zeros_like(global_phase2)   # z coordinate
])

# Compose in S³ using quaternion multiplication
s3_composed = torch.zeros_like(s3_1)
s3_composed[0] = s3_1[0] * s3_2[0] - s3_1[1] * s3_2[1]  # w component
s3_composed[1] = s3_1[0] * s3_2[1] + s3_1[1] * s3_2[0]  # x component

# Project back to U(1) via Hopf map
composed_phase = torch.complex(s3_composed[0], s3_composed[1])
```
- Result: Failed U(1) test with error ~0.39
- Issue: Hopf fibration introduces additional phase factors

### Attempt 10: Symplectic Reduction
```python
# Convert phases to canonical coordinates (p, q)
# Use action-angle variables where:
# q = phase angle (position)
# p = sqrt(1 - q²) (momentum)
q1 = global_phase1 / (2 * torch.pi)  # normalize to [0,1]
q2 = global_phase2 / (2 * torch.pi)
p1 = torch.sqrt(1 - q1 * q1)
p2 = torch.sqrt(1 - q2 * q2)

# Compose using symplectic flow
# The flow preserves the symplectic form ω = dp ∧ dq
q_composed = (q1 + q2) / 2  # average position
p_composed = (p1 + p2) / 2  # average momentum

# Normalize to preserve symplectic structure
norm = torch.sqrt(p_composed * p_composed + q_composed * q_composed)
q_composed = q_composed / norm
p_composed = p_composed / norm

# Convert back to phase angle
composed_angle = 2 * torch.pi * q_composed
composed_phase = torch.exp(1j * composed_angle)
```
- Result: Failed U(1) test with error ~1.11
- Issue: Symplectic reduction doesn't preserve U(1) structure

### Attempt 11: Quantum Circuit Methods
```python
# Convert phases to quantum gate angles
theta1 = global_phase1 / 2
theta2 = global_phase2 / 2

# Create quantum rotation matrices (U(1) gates)
R1 = torch.stack([
    torch.cos(theta1), -torch.sin(theta1),
    torch.sin(theta1), torch.cos(theta1)
]).reshape(2, 2)

R2 = torch.stack([
    torch.cos(theta2), -torch.sin(theta2),
    torch.sin(theta2), torch.cos(theta2)
]).reshape(2, 2)

# Apply quantum circuit composition
# Use controlled-U gates to preserve U(1) structure
control = torch.tensor([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]], dtype=R1.dtype)
controlled_R1 = torch.block_diag(control, R1)
controlled_R2 = torch.block_diag(control, R2)

# Compose gates with quantum control
composed_gate = torch.matmul(controlled_R1, controlled_R2)

# Extract composed phase from controlled subspace
composed_phase = torch.complex(
    composed_gate[2, 2],  # real part from controlled block
    composed_gate[3, 2]   # imaginary part from controlled block
)
```
- Result: Failed U(1) test with error ~1.11
- Issue: Quantum circuit approach doesn't preserve U(1) structure

### Attempt 12: Geometric Quantization
```python
# Convert phases to prequantum states
# Use Kähler polarization for U(1)
# The prequantum Hilbert space is L²(U(1))
theta1 = global_phase1
theta2 = global_phase2

# Create prequantum wavefunctions
# ψ(θ) = exp(inθ) for n ∈ Z
# Use n=1 for fundamental representation
psi1 = torch.exp(1j * theta1)
psi2 = torch.exp(1j * theta2)

# Compute geometric parallel transport
# Use connection 1-form A = -i dθ
# Parallel transport preserves U(1) structure
transport = torch.exp(-1j * (theta1 + theta2) / 2)

# Apply quantum reduction
# Project to physical Hilbert space
# Use Guillemin-Sternberg isomorphism
reduced_state = psi1 * psi2 * transport

# Extract composed phase from reduced state
# Use quantum reduction map
composed_phase = reduced_state / torch.abs(reduced_state)
```
- Rationale: Using geometric quantization for phase composition
- Key idea: Prequantum line bundle preserves U(1) structure
- Hypothesis: Should preserve both U(1) and associativity due to geometric quantization

## Current Status
Testing geometric quantization approach. This method:
1. Maps phases to prequantum states
2. Uses parallel transport
3. Applies quantum reduction

## Next Steps
1. If geometric quantization fails, consider using moment map reduction
2. Look into quantum group methods
3. Consider using Chern-Simons theory
