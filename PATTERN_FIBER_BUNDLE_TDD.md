## Implementation Notes

1. Each test section should be implemented in order
2. Use hypothesis for property-based testing
3. Maintain numerical stability in all computations
4. Ensure proper batch dimension handling throughout

## Success Criteria

1. All tests pass with specified tolerances
2. Property-based tests run without failures
3. Numerical stability maintained across all operations
4. Proper handling of edge cases and degenerate configurations

## Test Dependencies

1. pytest for test framework
2. hypothesis for property-based testing
3. torch for tensor operations
4. numpy for numerical validations
