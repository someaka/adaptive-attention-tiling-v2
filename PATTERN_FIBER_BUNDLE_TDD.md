## Current Issues

1. Performance Issues:
   - Connection form linearity test exceeding time limit
   - Levi-Civita symmetry test exceeding time limit

2. Implementation Issues:
   - Connection vertical preservation not working
   - Connection horizontal projection failing
   - Connection Levi-Civita compatibility errors
   - Metric derivatives failing symmetry test

## Implementation Notes

1. Each test section should be implemented in order
2. Use hypothesis for property-based testing
3. Maintain numerical stability in all computations
4. Ensure proper batch dimension handling throughout

## Success Criteria

1. All tests pass with specified tolerances
2. Property-based tests run without failures
3. Numerical stability maintained across all operations
4. Proper handling of edge cases and degenerate configurations

## Test Dependencies

1. pytest for test framework
2. hypothesis for property-based testing
3. torch for tensor operations
4. numpy for numerical validations
