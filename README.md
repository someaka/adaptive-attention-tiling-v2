# Adaptive Attention Tiling System v2

## Project Status

We have completed the implementation of a comprehensive performance testing framework for both CPU and Vulkan components. The framework is designed to evaluate and optimize the Adaptive Attention Tiling system's performance across different hardware configurations.

### Completed Components

1. **Performance Testing Framework** ([PERFORMANCE_TEST_INDEX.md](./PERFORMANCE_TEST_INDEX.md))
   - CPU Performance Tests
     - Vectorization tests
     - Memory management tests
     - Algorithm efficiency tests
   - Vulkan Performance Tests
     - Compute shader tests
     - Memory transfer tests
     - Synchronization tests
     - Pipeline optimization tests
   - Benchmarking Framework
     - Core operation benchmarks
     - Memory performance tests
     - Scaling analysis
     - Quality assurance tests

2. **Documentation**
   - [LIVING_INDEX.md](./LIVING_INDEX.md): Current project state and progress tracking
   - [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md): Detailed timeline and success metrics
   - [PERFORMANCE_TEST_INDEX.md](./PERFORMANCE_TEST_INDEX.md): Test suite documentation

### Current Technical State

#### Dependencies
- PyTorch >= 2.0.0
- NumPy >= 1.24.0
- JAX >= 0.4.13
- Other dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)

#### Known Issues
There is currently a compatibility issue between PyTorch's internal modules and NumPy 2.x versions. This affects the `torch._subclasses.functional_tensor` module.

### Next Steps

1. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Upgrade PyTorch to latest nightly build for NumPy 2.x compatibility
   - Alternative fallback: Temporarily pin NumPy to 1.x if upgrade unsuccessful

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Run the complete test suite
   - Generate baseline performance metrics
   - Identify optimization targets

3. **Optimization Phase**
   - Implement optimizations based on profiling results
   - Validate improvements against baseline metrics
   - Document performance gains
