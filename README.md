## Test Configuration

The test suite supports different hardware profiles through YAML configuration files. These profiles allow running tests with parameters optimized for different environments:

- `tiny`: For laptops and machines with limited resources (default)
- `standard`: For workstations with decent computational resources
- `server`: For high-performance servers

To run tests with a specific profile:

```bash
# Default (tiny profile)
pytest tests/

# With specific profile
PYTEST_PROFILE=standard pytest tests/
PYTEST_PROFILE=server pytest tests/
```

The configurations are stored in `configs/test_regimens/` and can be customized for your specific hardware setup.

### Symbolic Math Verification
The system uses SymPy for symbolic mathematics verification, particularly useful for:
- Verifying quantum field theory relationships
- Checking commutation relations
- Validating scaling equations
- Confirming algebraic identities in physics equations

Example of verifying the Callan-Symanzik equation relationships:
```python
from sympy import symbols, simplify, pi

# Define symbols
g, pi = symbols('g pi')

# Define QFT functions
gamma = g**2/(16*pi**2)      # Anomalous dimension
dgamma = g/(8*pi**2)         # Its derivative
beta = g**3/(32*pi**2)       # Beta function

# Verify Î²(g)âˆ‚_g Î³(g) = Î³(g)Â²
lhs = beta * dgamma
rhs = gamma**2
assert simplify(lhs - rhs) == 0
```
